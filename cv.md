### About Me
Since I was a teenager, I'v been fascinated by computers and technology.

Even though I got my law degree, computers have always been the most important part of my life. The desire to make attractive and well designed documents pushed me to study typography and design. The desire to simplify everyday work led me to discover ways to automate legal writing.

Front-end is the industry where my desires and aspirations came together. The analytical skills I gained during my studies and academic work allow me to formulate and solve quite complex problems and tasks.

My goal is to become a full-fledged front-end developer as soon as possible.
